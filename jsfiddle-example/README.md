# JSFiddle Example

## Modify a JSFiddle and add it to your web page
This example goes through the steps to modify an [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) JSFiddle demo to use a different tile server. First this we will test our changes in JSFiddle using the embed link. The example will show how to add the JSFiddle to a web page and then show moving HTML, CSS and JS to the web site. 

The fiddle currently is using the test Geoplatform National Highway Planning Network vector tile server. The steps below will first change the fiddle to use the test [Census 5-Digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area](https://beta.geoplatform.gov/metadata/895888d3-4f32-5143-88e2-e7b3612891f0) [Vector Tile Service](https://tileservice.geoplatform.gov/vector/edd18cd7_7adc_4428_a6d9_81072155427e/%7Bz%7D/%7Bx%7D/%7By%7D.mvt).

1. Go to the OpenLayers [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/fgdc_gp_demos/dtL1aufb/28/).

3. There will be 4 windows displayed. In the JavaScript+JQuery window, change the url to https://tileservice.geoplatform.gov/vector/edd18cd7_7adc_4428_a6d9_81072155427e/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt.
```
let mvt = new ol.layer.VectorTile({
  declutter: true,
  source: new ol.source.VectorTile({
    format: new ol.format.MVT(),
    url: 'https://tileservice.geoplatform.gov/vector/edd18cd7_7adc_4428_a6d9_81072155427e/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt',
  }),
  style: style
});
```
4. Click the Run button to load the changes. Now displayed is the zip code layer.

6. To make the layer distinguish the layer from the previous layer, change the style color to 0, 0, 0 and the widith to 2. Click Run to load the changes.
```
let style = new ol.style.Style({
  stroke: new ol.style.Stroke({
    color: 'rgb(0, 0, 0)',
    width: 2,
    opacity: 1,
  })
});
```

7. Now take a look at the embed button. This will show the embed snippet. You can use this or the iframe to put this in your web page. If you want to save your changes anonymously in the next step, copy and save the embed snippet.

9. When you are satisfied click save to save the changes to a new fiddle. You can save this by signing into your account or you can save it anonymously.
10. If you saved the fiddle anonymously your page will go to the new fiddle with an address like https://jsfiddle.net/nf8142bm/. If you save it to your account it will look more like https://jsfiddle.net/fgdc_gp_demos/dtL1aufb/28/
11. If you saved the changes in your account, then you will have an embed button with the new embed snippet. If not, change the embed snippet you copied earlier to point to the new fiddle. 

For example:
```
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/fgdc_gp_demos/dtL1aufb/28/embed/"></script>
```
Would become:
```
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/fgdc_gp_demos/nf8142bm/embed/"></script>
```
11. To change the order of the tabs displayed, you can reorder the tabs like this:
```
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/fgdc_gp_demos/nf8142bm/embed/result,js,css,html"></script>
```
12. To put these on a web page, add the above [script to your page](https://github.com/chris-macdermaid/chris-macdermaid.github.io/blob/gh-pages/docs/fiddle.html). This example adds the original fiddle and the modified fiddle. These have the JSFiddle navigation.

14. To move the map to your site from JSFiddle. Create an HTML page with the resources (ol.js, ol.css, and jquery). Then create the css and js file with the information in JSFiddle in your web site's assets.
These are the files in the GitHub Pages test site:
[fiddle-web.html](https://github.com/chris-macdermaid/chris-macdermaid.github.io/blob/gh-pages/docs/fiddle-web.html)
[fiddle.js](https://github.com/chris-macdermaid/chris-macdermaid.github.io/blob/gh-pages/docs/assets/js/fiddle.js)
[fiddle.css](https://github.com/chris-macdermaid/chris-macdermaid.github.io/blob/gh-pages/docs/assets/css/fiddle.css) Since this is no longer using the navigation to other views, I've removed it from the css.
15. Test your changes locally.
16. Push the repo to GitHub
17. This GitHub Pages site is set to run out of the gh-pages branch from the doc directory. The source code is [here](https://github.com/chris-macdermaid/chris-macdermaid.github.io/tree/gh-pages/docs).

## Tools

## [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)
JSFiddle is an online IDE service and online community for testing and showcasing user-created and collaborational HTML, CSS and JavaScript code snippets, known as 'fiddles'. It allows for simulated AJAX calls.
JSFiddle allows users to publicly save their code an uncapped number of times for free. Each version is saved online at the application's website with an incremental numbered suffix. This allows users to re-access their saved code. Code saved on JSFiddle may also be edited into new versions, shared with other parties, and forked into a new line

The Open-Source Interactive Maps that the [Beta GeoPlatform](https://beta.geoplatform.gov/apps-demos) highlights using JSFiddle:
* [Leaflet (Raster & Vector tiles)](https://jsfiddle.net/user/fgdc_gp_demos/fiddles/)
* [OpenLayers (Vector tiles)](https://jsfiddle.net/user/fgdc_gp_demos/fiddles/)
* [Mapbox (Raster tiles)](https://jsfiddle.net/user/fgdc_gp_demos/fiddles/)
* [Other Examples](https://jsfiddle.net/user/fgdc_gp_demos/fiddles/)
